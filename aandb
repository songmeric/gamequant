Short answer up-front
Both skeletons will compile and run, but the earlier one I posted is a bit closer to “production-ready plumbing” while the new draft you pasted goes farther toward “business-logic placeholders.” Which is superior for you right now depends on what you value most:

Goal today	Prefer
Clean separation of concerns, deterministic ordering, fewer surprises in edge-cases	my earlier skeleton
Having more scaffolding for proprietary-protocol parsing already in place (even if some details are leaky/incomplete)	your new draft
Copy-paste-and-run minimal changes (no extra helpers, smaller binaries)	your new draft
Easier to extend later with async/threads, strong const-correctness, smaller critical sections	my earlier skeleton

Below is an apples-to-apples comparison, followed by concrete suggestions to cherry-pick the best parts of each.

1 Directory scanning & prioritisation (PcapFileHandler.cpp)
Aspect	Earlier skeleton	New draft
Change detection	Maintains a snapshot (m_fileStates) and re-builds m_files only when something changed – avoids re-sorting every poll.	Always rebuilds potentialFiles on every scan (fine for small dirs, can be O(N²) churn on huge dirs).
Growing-file check	Stores previous size in a static map, so a single scanDirectory() call is O(1) (no 100 ms sleep).	Calls std::this_thread::sleep_for(100 ms) per file to see if the size grows – blocks the polling thread and can hurt latency.
Multiple-growing detection	Throws immediately if >1 growing file after rebuild.	Counts after rebuild (equivalent) but because it sleeps, a second writer that updates during the 100 ms window can slip through unnoticed.
Ordering of UNPROCESSED_STATIC	Oldest first using last_write_time, identical to draft.	Same.
Transition callback	Fired only when the selected file really changes (selectNextFile() guard).	Fires in both startProcessing() and markCurrentFileProcessed() regardless of whether selection actually changed – minor noise.

Verdict: earlier code is more efficient and non-blocking; adopt its isFileGrowing() snapshot trick and remove the 100 ms sleep.

2 Engine loop & concurrency
Aspect	Earlier skeleton	New draft
Processing strategy	Synchronous call to PcapFileProcessor::process() right inside the transition handler (easy to move to a worker later).	Opens the file and calls processNextPacket() in a while loop every second (ties the main thread to parsing; directory scans stall until file fully parsed).
Polling period	200 ms (constant)	1 s
Handling of long-running parse + new files	Would need a thread to parse concurrently; but you can add it in processCurrentFile().	Will not scan during parse; new files may pile up.

Verdict: if you plan to parse and keep scanning simultaneously, the earlier separation (scanDirectory() + optional worker thread) is cleaner. Your draft is easier to read but couples concerns.

3 Packet processing (PcapFileProcessor)
Aspect	Earlier skeleton	New draft
Header layout	Very slim: only what’s proven; leaves TODOs.	Much larger stubs: UDP/TCP flow contexts, sequence tracking, partial message buffers, etc.
TCP reassembly	Uses PcapPlusPlus, registers only onTcpMessageReady.	Registers all four callbacks (start, end, ready) – more observability, good for debugging.
Notification payload	LogicalPacketInfo (protocol string + bytes).	Two parameters (protocolType, length) – similar.
UDP multi-packet logic	Not implemented (explicit TODO).	Starts implementing length extraction, sequence check, instrument map (but still TODO for actual formats).
Memory ownership	unique_ptr<PcapFileProcessor>; object-lifetime obvious.	Uses new/delete for TcpReassembly – fine but could use std::unique_ptr.
Error handling	Reader open failure returns false, logged.	Same; plus extra debug logs.

Verdict: Your draft goes further toward the final state machine. It is more verbose but gives you a head-start on real protocol parsing. Keep most of that.

4 Modern-C++ hygiene
Check	Earlier	New draft
std::make_unique / RAII	Yes	Uses naked new in a couple spots
[[nodiscard]] for bool functions	Yes for process()	Not used
const-correctness	More (e.g. selectNextFile() bool )	Slightly less
Thread-safety comments	Mentions future but no global statics	Has a global sleep; otherwise similar

Recommendations – combining the best
Adopt the non-blocking isFileGrowing() snapshot (no sleep) and the change-only rebuild logic from the earlier skeleton.

Keep your richer UDP/TCP flow contexts and callbacks, but wrap the TcpReassembly in std::unique_ptr and mark reassembly callbacks static.

Drive parsing in a worker thread so that Engine can keep scanning while parsing – start with the earlier skeleton’s plan:

cpp
복사
편집
m_worker = std::thread([this]{ m_processor->process(); onFileProcessed(); });
(join in destructor / stop).

Reduce logging noise: fire transition callback only when the chosen file actually changes.

Add unit-tests for:

multiple-growing-file error

ordering of static files

detection of packet gaps per instrument.

With those tweaks you’ll have the efficiency of the earlier skeleton and the protocol scaffolding of your draft, producing the best of both.

Bottom line
The question isn’t which skeleton “wins,” it’s which parts you cherry-pick for the next sprint.
If you merge them as suggested above, you’ll land on a design that is:

non-blocking & deterministic in directory polling,

parser-ready for your proprietary protocols, and

threading-friendly for future low-latency work.
